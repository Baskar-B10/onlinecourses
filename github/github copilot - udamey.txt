features, tips and tricks
inline comments:
inline comment to generate input tag like username in html page and validate the username with our own requirement using regex in JavaScript . create own rule in comment and it generate code.

context:
giving comments to check code - will not get any suggestion from copilot chat
provide context to get the suggestion 
1. open file and ask anything
2. add  workspace in context
3. add context with the file

prompts:
we can provide prompts with example and ask, it gives suggestion if there any built in function available or third party library 

if we ask like any built in function available or third party library  without example, it will provide the suggestion

unit test case:
select code and context with file name, it generate test cases with plan of every scenarios and generate the code.

explain code:
@workspace/explain and  select the code to get the explanation of code with example and explanation for each example case.

Assist with terminal error:
any error in terminal of vs code , we can get explanation for the error and solution for the error using @terminal command or using magic icon  
provide commands to run and select the terminal icon , it will get execute

commit message:
copilot provide commit message when we click magic icon on commit message.

copilot chat in mobile:
app is there to get GitHub copilot chat, will have repo details for our account.
. its like chatgpt
get suggestion for code using chat  and commit change in mobile 

public repository suggestion:
GitHub have vast amount of repo as reference to provide suggestion.
we can disable it
under settings/copilot, suggestion matching public repo - allow /blocked. we can provide access for developers to change settings in enterprise

once we write the code , we can check view/output/ GitHub copilot log will provide details for the code that matches to reference in any other repo 

refactor code:
refactor the selected code with modern <language > , it will give plan and code, we can replace it . reduces line also.

Generate backend code:
provide proper prompt with your requirement include less third party jar usages , highlight vulnerabilities and provide solution for that.
 also prompt to get how to run it on server.

detect vulnerabilities:

prompt to detect vulnerability and solution

learning tool:

GitHub copilot CLI:
details for CLI tool installation  from internet 
in terminal , login with Gh account

auto populate for loop array , change the index is easier
code ->settings-> configure snippet and select js, create snippet with our own requirement details along  prefix as unique value. when we provide the prefix value(generate dummy data) in coding , and provide the details(generate id, data type with files- we can replace the data type and field with our customization )  to create , it will create the data based on our requirement.

#editor - visible source code in active editor
#file - provide the file name like attaching context  
#terminalLastcommand- shows last command executed in terminal
#terminalSelection - select the command in terminal and we can do explain or execute 
#VsCodeApI- information based on code API 

3)/help - gives details about shortcuts and commands

convert Js code to phython 
install phyton extension 
#selection with  select code and give prompt to convert into python code.
